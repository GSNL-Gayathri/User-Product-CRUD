# User-Product-CRUD
This is a simple Node.js application using Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose(MongoDB).
I have used mongoose Schemas for building these APIs.
The requirements involves the following:
1) User registration
2) While register the user by using 'pre' method to save the encripted password.
3) User Login
4) JWT Token verification.
5) Get all users - user need authenticated.
6) Create products - user need authenticated.
7) Read all products - user need authenticated.
8) Update product - user need authenticated.
9) Delete Product - user need authenticated.
